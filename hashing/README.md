# üß† Python Algorithm Explanations

This repository contains clear and concise explanations of several fundamental algorithms implemented in Python.  
Each algorithm demonstrates core concepts of data structures, hashing, and efficient problem-solving patterns often used in technical interviews and programming practice.

## üî§ Anagrams

**Purpose:**  
Determine whether two strings are *anagrams* ‚Äî that is, whether they contain the same letters in any order.

**Explanation:**  
The algorithm counts how many times each character appears in both words and compares these counts.  
If both words have identical frequency counts for all letters, they are anagrams.

**Key Concepts:**  
- Character frequency counting  
- Hash maps (Python dictionaries)  
- String comparison

## üîÅ Intersections

**Purpose:**  
Find all common elements between two lists.

**Explanation:**  
The algorithm converts one list into a set for faster lookup and then checks which elements from the second list also appear in that set.  
This method efficiently identifies shared items between collections.

**Key Concepts:**  
- Sets for O(1) membership checks  
- Iteration and filtering  
- Efficient list comparison

## üî° Most Frequent Character

**Purpose:**  
Identify the character that appears most frequently in a string.

**Explanation:**  
A dictionary is used to count how often each character occurs.  
The algorithm then finds the character with the highest frequency by comparing counts.  
This is a classic example of using hash tables for frequency analysis.

**Key Concepts:**  
- Hash tables / dictionaries  
- Frequency counting  
- Comparison logic to track maximum values

## ‚úñÔ∏è Pair Product

**Purpose:**  
Find two numbers in a list whose product equals a given target value.

**Explanation:**  
As the algorithm iterates through the list, it calculates what complementary number would be needed to reach the target product.  
It uses a dictionary to keep track of numbers already seen, allowing it to find matching pairs efficiently without nested loops.

**Key Concepts:**  
- Hash maps for constant-time lookups  
- Complementary value logic  
- Reducing O(n¬≤) search to O(n)

## ‚ûï Pair Sum

**Purpose:**  
Find two numbers in a list that add up to a specified target sum.

**Explanation:**  
The algorithm loops through the list while keeping track of previously seen numbers i
